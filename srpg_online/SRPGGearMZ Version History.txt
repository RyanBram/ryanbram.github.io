2024/11/15 Ver.1.21Q :
- Added the SRPG_TerrainEffectPlus plugin to enhance terrain effects.
- Added a feature to SRPG_UX_Windows to display a status bar when the cursor is on a unit.
- Improved SRPG_UX_Windows to allow different status bar colors for allies and enemies.

- Fixed a bug where state effects were not correctly applied to enemies using actor IDs.

2024/10/2 Version 1.20Q :
- Added tags <unitEventForActor>, <unitEventForEnemy>, and <unitEventForAll> to events for unit-based triggers.
  <unitEvent> and <unitEventForActor>: Executes when an actor steps on it.
  <unitEventForEnemy>: Executes when an enemy steps on it.
  <unitEventForAll>: Executes when either an actor or enemy steps on it.
  Note: This is technically determined by BattlePhase rather than the unit type that steps on it.

- Improved the reward screen so that money is not displayed when the amount gained is 0.
- Fixed a bug where values represented as percentages (like evasion rate) were not accurately stored in variables when using the script/plugin command "Retrieve Unit Parameters" (now correctly stored by multiplying decimal values by 100 and converting them to integers).
- Fixed a bug where the distance between events based on actor ID (e.g., this.actorActorDistance()) would return incorrect values when there was a acting/target event involved (such as during <type:afterAction> execution).

2024/9/18 Ver.1.19Q :
- The process for calling the menu screen using the cancel key has been improved to reduce the likelihood of conflicts.

2024/9/7 Ver.1.18Q :
[Specification Changes]
- Changes to AoE Mechanics:
  - The details on how to create AoE skills have been updated in the SRPG_AoE.js help file.
  - Area Attacks:
    - Removed the functionality of directly setting the skill's range as the AoE range with <srpgAreaType:allActor> and <srpgAreaType:allEnemy>.
    - When creating a skill that targets the area around the user, change it to an AoE skill with a range of 0.
    - To ensure that enemies and auto-controlled actors use area attacks correctly, SRPG_AIControl.js is required.
  - Global Attacks:
    - Added <srpgAreaType:allFriend> and <srpgAreaType:allOpponent> tags to specify allied or opposing factions for global attack skills.
    - You can create a global skill that targets everyone by combining <srpgAreaRange:X> (set to 1 or higher) with <srpgAreaType:allFriend>, <srpgAreaType:allOpponent>, <srpgAreaType:allActor>, or <srpgAreaType:allEnemy>. The <specialRange:X> tag is no longer necessary.

[Improvements & Fixes]
- Added a "Guest Actor" feature (allows the same ID actor to be copied and participate in battle). Adding <type:guest><id:X> in the event's memo will create a guest actor.
- Added functionality in SRPG_BattleUI to adjust the number of displayed actors and their graphics in the menu screen (configurable via plugin parameters).
- Added the <srpgUseActorParamId:X> tag for enemies, allowing them to copy the parameters, equipment, and traits of a specified actor ID, creating an enemy identical to that actor.
- Added the <hideHpMp:true> tag to SRPG_UX_Windows, which allows HP, MP, and TP to be displayed as "???". A state tag <showHpMp:true> has also been added to disable <hideHpMp:true>.
- Improved the <noRewards:true> tag so it can now be used with actors and classes to prevent receiving rewards (experience, money, items).
- Improved the <mapBattle:true> and <mapBattle:false> tags, making them usable with actors and enemies to set map battles.
- Enhanced to show damage/healing from HP regeneration traits on the map.
- "After Action Processing" (<type:afterAction>) and "Unit Events" (<type:unitEvent>) now retain the "Event ID during action" (default stored in variable 4) and the "Target Event ID" (stored in variable 5).
- Improved script/plugin commands that specify an event ID to allow input of "Event ID during action" and "Target Event ID" (with event ID 0 referencing the event ID during action and -1 referencing the target event ID).
- Optimized the rendering of AoE range display sprites.
- Fixed a bug where SRPG battles would freeze upon ending if resumed from save data created with versions before Ver.1.16Q.
- Fixed an issue where the Counterattack Skill with skill ID 1 (default is "Attack") would use normal attacks to counter, even if normal attacks had been replaced with other skills via traits or tags.
- Fixed a bug where the script command this.unitAddState() would not properly apply the death state.
- Corrected a bug where the cursor would move during "After Action Processing" (<type:afterAction>) and "Unit Events" (<type:unitEvent>) if the plugin command "Start On Next Actor" was set to true in SRPG_UX_Cursor.
- Fixed an issue where level-up notifications could appear on the reward window even for units that had reached their level cap.
- Corrected a bug where defeating an enemy during a counterattack in scene battles could trigger victory processing multiple times.

2024/6/15　Ver.1.17Q :
- Added a feature to SRPG_PositionEffects to set regions that cannot be selected by <cellTarget> skills.
- (MZ) Modified to allow toggling the display of the arrow button in the upper-left corner of the screen via plugin parameters.
- (MZ) Fixed a bug where touch UI buttons did not display correctly at the start of battles when not using 'BattlePrepare.js'.

2024/6/13 Ver.1.16Q:
- Added <userActionIs:tag> to the tags (notes) for skills and items, allowing conditions based on the opponent's skills when used in counterattacks (stricter counterattack conditions enable more appropriate actions. Example: a counterattack that triggers only when receiving a physical attack from the enemy).
- Added the script command this.removeUnit(eventId); to remove actors/enemies from battle. Unlike incapacitation, this completely removes them from SRPG battle. If it’s an actor, they will also leave the party. (MZ)This will also be added to plugin commands.
- Added the ability to change the status window colors for actors/enemies in SRPG_UX_Windows (changeable via plugin parameters).
- Added the <noRewards> tag to skills, which prevents receiving rewards (experience points, money, drop items) when set with <noRewards:true>.
- Improved two-attack (follow-up attack) based on agility difference, allowing judgment based on the absolute value of the difference instead of the ratio (changeable via plugin parameters).
- Improved two-attack (follow-up attack) based on agility difference to allow changing whether attacks occur based on probability if the set ratio/value is not met (changeable via plugin parameters). Setting it to OFF will disable two-attacks if the set value is not met.
- Corrected the judgment of whether skills/items can be used in two-attacks (follow-up attacks) based on agility.
- Improved the "Change Actor Image" event command so that changes in walking graphics are reflected on the map units.
- Improved behavior for mouse operations (especially when the cursor follows the mouse) (MouseOperation.js).
- Fixed an issue where some description texts were overflowing from windows in the English version sample game.
- Fixed the cellTarget issue in SRPG_PositionEffects.js (unable to select on bridges, or selectable on non-movable objects).
- Fixed an error in SRPG_AuraSkill when trying to make a target unable to act with an aura (state) within the aura’s range.
- Improved the application timing of aura skills to better respond to auras that change movement power.
- Improved the display position (Z-coordinate) of actor sprites in battle scenes.
- Fixed an issue where the number of activations increased excessively when using multi-activation skills in map battles.
- Added a touch button for switching actors to the top left of the screen (MZ).
- Improved to allow using Time Progress Battle in non-SRPG battles (SRPG battles remain turn-based) (MZ).
- Fixed an issue where the display position of the actor command window would shift if the screen size and UI size were different (MZ).
- Fixed an issue where the display of actors and backgrounds would shift in battle scenes when using AoE skills if the screen size and UI size were different (MZ).
- Fixed an issue where the state change log window would be displayed repeatedly in battle scenes (changed to perform clearResult after an action) (MZ).

- Supported both Japanese and English plugin helps. (Special Thanks to: Gotcha Gotcha Games)
